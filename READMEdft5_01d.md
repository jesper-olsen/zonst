--- DEMONSTRATING THE STRETCHING THEOREM ---
Stretching a signal in the time domain causes its frequency
spectrum to compress, and vice-versa.

[PART 1] First, a compact signal and its transform.
--> Press Enter to continue...

Plotting the compact signal and its transform.
--> Displaying plots. Close the plot window to continue.

[PART 2] Now, we stretch the time signal by inserting zeros.
--> Press Enter to continue...

Plotting the stretched signal and its transform.
--> Displaying plots. Close the plot window to continue.

--- CONCLUSION ---
Notice the frequency plot in Part 2 is a compressed version of the plot from Part 1.
This demonstrates that stretching the time signal compressed its frequency spectrum.
