Discrete Fourier Transform
==========================

---

The demo shows the result of approximating a square wave with a number of fourier terms.
The approximation is getting increasingly more accurate as more terms are added.

Edit the source code to experiment with a few other input signals...

```
% cargo run --bin main
NUMBER OF TERMS?
8
```
