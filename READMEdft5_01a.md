Similarity Theorem
==========================

Run
---

This demo shows how changing the width of a time-domain pulse affects its frequency-domain spectrum.

Below widths of 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1 are illustrated.

```
% uv run python dft5_01a.py

     MAIN MENU
 1 = SIMILARITY THEOREM
 2 = EXIT

      MAKE SELECTION: 1

Current signal width = 16 (max: 16, min: 1)
Enter new width: 16
Close the plot window to continue.
More (y/n)? y

Current signal width = 16 (max: 16, min: 1)
Enter new width: 8
Close the plot window to continue.
More (y/n)? y

Current signal width = 8 (max: 16, min: 1)
Enter new width: 4
Close the plot window to continue.
More (y/n)? y

Current signal width = 4 (max: 16, min: 1)
Enter new width: 2
Close the plot window to continue.
More (y/n)? y

Current signal width = 2 (max: 16, min: 1)
Enter new width: 1
Close the plot window to continue.
More (y/n)? n
